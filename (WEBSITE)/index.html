         <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving</p>

         <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">When most people hear the term artificial intelligence, the first thing they usually think of is robots. That's because big-budget films and novels weave stories about human-like machines that wreak havoc on Earth. But nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
         <br>
         <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Artificial intelligence is based on the principle that human intelligence can be defined in a way that a machine can easily mimic it and execute tasks, from the most simple to those that are even more complex. The goals of artificial intelligence include learning, reasoning, and perception</p>

Weak AI systems include video games such as the chess example from above and personal assistants such as Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri. You ask the assistant a question, it answers it for you<br><br> STRONG ARTIFICIAL INTELLEIGENCE - systems are systems that carry on the tasks considered to be human-like. These tend to be more complex and complicated systems. They are programmed to handle situations in which they may be required to problem solve without having a person intervene. These kinds of systems can be found in applications like self-driving cars or in hospital operating rooms.</p>

      <p class="sectionTag text-big">Special Considerations</p>
       <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> Since its beginning, artificial intelligence has come under scrutiny from scientists and the public alike. One common theme is the idea that machines will become so highly developed that humans will not be able to keep up and they will take off on their own, redesigning themselves at an exponential rate.<br>Another is that machines can hack into people's privacy and even be weaponized. Other arguments debate the ethics of artificial intelligence and whether intelligent systems such as robots should be treated with the same rights as humans.<br>Self-driving cars have been fairly controversial as their machines tend to be designed for the lowest possible risk and the least casualties. If presented with a scenario of colliding with one person or another at the same time, these cars would calculate the option that would cause the least amount of damage.</p>

       <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's neuroscience startup Neuralink has unveiled a pig with a small computer chip implanted in its brain. Describing the implant as 'a Fitbit in your skull with tiny wires', Musk said the pig was 'happy and healthy' two months after initially having it fitted. He presented a demo displaying the pig's neurons firing 'in real time'.</p>

           <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">It may look like a slick motorcycle with propellors, but it’s actually a flying car made by Japan’s SkyDrive Inc. — and yes, it can fly.

            In a test flight video shown to reporters on Friday, the contraption, with one person aboard, lifted 1-2 meters off the ground and hovered in a netted area at Toyota Test Field for four minutes, CGTN.com reported.
        
            Local media outlets said it was the first public demonstration for a flying car in Japanese history.
        
            Tomohiro Fukuzawa, who heads the SkyDrive effort, said he hopes “the flying car” can be made into a real-life product by 2023, but he acknowledged that making it safe was critical.
        
            “Of the world’s more than 100 flying car projects, only a handful have succeeded with a person on board,” he told The Associated Press. “I hope many people will want to ride it and feel safe.” For More info visit </p>
